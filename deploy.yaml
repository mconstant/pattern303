# Akash SDL (Stack Definition Language) for Pattern 303
# Documentation: https://akash.network/docs/deployments/akash-sdl
#
# To deploy:
# 1. Build and push Docker image with build args:
#    docker buildx build \
#      --build-arg VITE_TREASURY_WALLET=YOUR_WALLET \
#      --build-arg VITE_303_TOKEN_MINT=YOUR_TOKEN_MINT \
#      -t ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/pattern303:latest \
#      --push \
#      .
# 2. Deploy via Akash Console (https://console.akash.network) or CLI
#
# NOTE: VITE_TREASURY_WALLET and VITE_303_TOKEN_MINT are baked into the build,
# not passed at runtime, because Vite embeds them during the build process.
